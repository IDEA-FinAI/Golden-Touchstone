Golden Touchstone is a simple, effective, and systematic benchmark for bilingual (Chinese-English) financial large language models, driving the research and implementation of financial large language models, akin to a touchstone. We also have trained and open-sourced Touchstone-GPT as a baseline for subsequent community research.
